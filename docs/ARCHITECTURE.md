# Architecture

**Status:** Documents the architecture as built through the Public Website Epic (Milestone 6B) — infrastructure, design system, Marketing Section Library, page-composite pattern, and configuration layer are in place; database schema is still empty (Epic B is next, see [ROADMAP_V2.md](./ROADMAP_V2.md)). This document is the canonical reference for what exists **today** — [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](./PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) holds only a condensed summary and links here. For how this architecture is meant to evolve toward a reusable platform, see [PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md](./PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md) — that document does not change anything below; it explains direction, not current state. For naming/formatting conventions that implement this architecture, see [DEVELOPMENT_CONVENTIONS.md](./DEVELOPMENT_CONVENTIONS.md).

## 1. High-Level Architecture

A single Next.js 15 application (App Router) serves three distinct experiences from one codebase:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  Next.js 15 App                       │

│         └───────────────┴──────────────────┘           │
│                          │                              │
│                 Route Handlers (API)                    │
│                          │                              │
│                    Prisma ORM                           │
└──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┘
                           │
                  ┌────────┴─────────┐
                  │   PostgreSQL      │
                  └───────────────────┘

              External: Auth.js (sessions) · Cloudinary (media)
```

There is no separate backend service. Business logic lives in Route Handlers and Server Actions within the Next.js app. This keeps the system deployable as a single Vercel project with no infrastructure to manage.

## 2. Folder Structure

Application code is nested under `src/`; `prisma/`, `public/`, `docs/`, and root config files stay at the repository root — see [DECISIONS.md § D-007](./DECISIONS.md#d-007--src-directory-layout). The internal composition below (route groups, component categories, lib organization) is unchanged from the original design.

```

**Principle:** Route groups `(public)`, `(admin)`, `(teacher)` create hard visual and logical boundaries. A file inside `(admin)` should never be reachable by a Teacher session, enforced at the layout level, not just by UI hiding.

**Configuration layer (`src/config/`):** School-identity, branding, navigation, contact, social, and SEO-default values are centralized here as plain, framework-free data — see [DECISIONS.md § D-018](./DECISIONS.md#d-018--centralized-configuration-layer-srcconfig). This is deliberately not `lib/` (which holds behavior/utilities) or a page's own `content.ts` (which holds page-specific copy) — it's the one place a fact that's true across the whole site (the school's name, for instance) is defined once.

---

## 3. Routing Strategy

- **App Router** exclusively — no Pages Router usage.
- Route groups segment by role: `(public)`, `(auth)`, `(admin)`, `(teacher)`.
- Each protected route group has a `layout.tsx` that verifies session + role server-side before rendering any child route. Unauthorized access redirects to `/login`, not a client-side error state.
- Dynamic segments (e.g., `students/[id]`) used for entity detail views.
- No route should perform role checks only on the client. Server-side enforcement is mandatory (see Security Principles).

---

## 4. Rendering Strategy — Server vs Client Components

**Default: Server Components.** A component is a Client Component only when it needs one of:

- Interactivity (`onClick`, `onChange`, form state)
- Browser-only APIs
- React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
- Third-party libraries that require the client (e.g., some Framer Motion usage)

**Pattern:**

- Pages fetch data on the server (Server Components / Server Actions) and pass minimal, serializable props down.
- Interactive leaves (a form, a filter, a modal trigger) are isolated Client Components, kept as small as possible.
- Avoid marking entire pages `"use client"` — push the boundary down to the smallest necessary component.

**Data mutations** use Server Actions where practical (forms, simple mutations); Route Handlers are used for endpoints consumed by client-side fetch/polling or external integrations.

---

## 5. State Management Strategy

This product intentionally avoids heavyweight global state libraries.

| Type of state                                    | Approach                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server data (students, attendance, etc.)         | Fetched in Server Components; re-fetched via Server Actions/router refresh after mutation |
| Form state                                       | Local component state, or `react-hook-form` where forms are non-trivial                   |
| Auth/session state                               | Auth.js session, accessed server-side via `auth()` helper                                 |
| Transient UI state (modals, tabs, toasts)        | Local `useState`, lifted only as far as necessary                                         |
| Cross-cutting UI state (theme, sidebar collapse) | React Context, minimal and scoped                                                         |

No Redux, Zustand, Jotai, or similar libraries in Version 1 unless a specific, documented need arises (see [AI_RULES.md](./AI_RULES.md) on introducing dependencies).

## 6. Component Hierarchy

```
Layout (role shell: sidebar/topbar)
 └─ Page (Server Component — fetches data)
     └─ Section (Server Component — composes UI)
         └─ Feature Composite (e.g., AttendanceTable)
             └─ Shadcn Primitives (Table, Badge, Button)
             └─ Client Islands (e.g., AttendanceRowToggle — "use client")
```

- **Primitives** (`components/ui`): unmodified or lightly themed Shadcn components, plus cross-cutting presentational primitives like typography. Never role-specific.
- **Shared composites** (`components/shared`): reusable across roles — page headers, empty states, confirmation dialogs, theme provider/toggle.
- **Role composites** (`components/website`, `components/admin`, `components/teacher`): feature-specific, built from primitives + shared composites. `website/` serves the Guest role (see [DECISIONS.md § D-011](./DECISIONS.md#d-011--componentswebsite-folder)).
- **Reusable section libraries** (`components/website/sections`): a large, general-purpose set of composites within a role (the Marketing Section Library — `PageHero`, `FeatureGrid`, etc., see [DECISIONS.md § D-012](./DECISIONS.md#d-012--marketing-section-library-location-componentswebsitesections-not-srcfeatures)) gets its own subfolder, one folder per component: `ComponentName/ComponentName.tsx`, `.types.ts`, optionally `.constants.ts` (only when there's a real variant-to-className map worth extracting), `README.md`, and `index.ts` re-exporting the component and its types. Apply this pattern to any future role's composite library that grows past a handful of flat files — not retroactively to existing single-file composites that don't need it.
- **Page composites** (`components/website/pages`): a full page assembled from the section library (About, Admissions, and future pages) gets its own folder, `PageName/`: `page.tsx` (composition only), `content.ts` (framework-free copy), `sections.ts` (shapes `content.ts` into library component props), `metadata.ts` (page-specific title/description passed to `lib/seo.ts`'s shared `buildPageMetadata()`/`buildPageJsonLd()`), `README.md`, `index.ts`. The actual `app/(public)/<page>/page.tsx` route file is a one-line re-export — see [DECISIONS.md § D-016](./DECISIONS.md#d-016--page-composite-folder-pattern-componentswebsitepagespage--thin-route-re-export).
- **`README.md` proportionality:** the six-section template (Purpose/Props/Variants/Accessibility Notes/Usage Example/Future Enhancements) is the default, but sections that don't apply to a trivial component (e.g., no `Variants` section for a component with no variant prop) should be omitted rather than filled with boilerplate like "None anticipated" — the README should be as long as the component actually warrants, not a fixed-length form.
- **Feature-subgrouping threshold:** a role folder (`components/admin/`, `components/teacher/`, or `components/website/` outside `sections/`) should adopt the same per-component-folder subgrouping once it exceeds roughly 8 components spanning more than 2 distinct domains (e.g., `components/admin/attendance/`, `components/admin/marks/`). Below that threshold, flat files in the role folder are simpler and should not be preemptively subdivided. See [DECISIONS.md § D-013](./DECISIONS.md#d-013--phase-1b1-architecture-review-reaffirmed-role-segmented-components-added-a-feature-subgrouping-threshold-rule).

## 7. Security Principles

1. **Server-enforced authorization.** Every protected route and every Route Handler independently verifies the session and role — the UI never being the only gate.
2. **Least privilege by role.** Teachers can only query/mutate data scoped to their own assigned classes; this is enforced in the data layer (query filters), not just the UI.
3. **Input validation everywhere data enters the system.** All form and API inputs validated with Zod schemas before touching the database.
4. **No secrets in client code.** Environment variables containing secrets are server-only (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix unless genuinely public).
5. **Session security.** Auth.js sessions use secure, httpOnly cookies; no tokens stored in `localStorage`.
6. **Auditability.** Sensitive mutations (student records, marks, attendance) should be attributable to the acting user for future audit-log support.

---

## 8. Performance Principles

1. **Server Components first** — reduces client JS shipped for content-heavy pages (public site, tables).
2. **Streaming & Suspense** for slower data fetches (e.g., report generation) so the shell renders immediately.
3. **Image optimization** via `next/image` and Cloudinary transformations — never unoptimized `<img>` for content images.
4. **Minimal client bundle** — Framer Motion and other client-heavy libraries loaded only where used, not globally.
5. **Database access patterns** — Prisma queries scoped and indexed appropriately; avoid N+1 patterns in list views (attendance, student lists).
6. **Caching** — static/public content (marketing pages, notices) leverages Next.js caching/ISR where appropriate; authenticated dashboards remain dynamic.

---

## 9. Open Architectural Questions

- Exact Auth.js provider strategy (credentials-based vs. email magic link) for Admin/Teacher accounts
- Multi-tenancy: this is single-school in v1 — confirm no multi-school abstraction is needed prematurely
- File/document storage conventions in Cloudinary (folder/naming strategy)

Tracked alongside product-level open questions in [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md § Open Questions](./PROJECT_CONTEXT.md#12-open-questions) and [FEATURE_STATUS.md](./FEATURE_STATUS.md).
